# 🧰 Machine Shop Suite

### Open-source software for modern fabrication.

We build free and open tools that power the next generation of digital manufacturing - from quoting to production.  
Our goal is simple: **make fabrication software fast, transparent, and fully in your control.**

## 💡 What We’re Building

**Machine Shop Suite** is an ecosystem of open-source products designed for 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC machining, and other fabrication workflows.

We’re starting small - but thinking big.

Our roadmap includes:
- ⚙️ **Instant Quote Engines** for 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC  
- 🧾 **Shop Management Software** for tracking jobs, materials, and costs  
- 🖨️ **Machine Connectivity** (OctoPrint, MQTT, local APIs)  
- 📊 **Shop Floor Dashboard** for real-time production insights  
- 💬 **CRM + Business Tools** for client communication, quotes, and payments  
- ☁️ **Optional Hosted Platform** for teams that prefer managed infrastructure  

Everything we make is:
- 🧩 **Open-source and modular** — use what you need  
- 🛠️ **Self-hosted** — you own your data and control your stack  
- ⚡ **Fast by design** — built for the realities of shop floors

## 🫱 Our Philosophy

We believe fabrication businesses deserve tools that:
- don’t lock you into monthly plans,  
- don’t hide behind APIs, and  
- don’t slow down your workflow.

Whether you run a small print farm or a full-scale manufacturing floor — you should have **software that feels like your own machine**.
